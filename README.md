# Zero-Knowledge Protocols Learning Repository

Welcome to the Zero-Knowledge Protocols Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to helping you explore various zero-knowledge approaches and protocols, including zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and related concepts.

## Approaches

You will find resources and lessons on different zero-knowledge approaches:

- **zk-SNARKs:** Learn about Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge protocols and their applications.

- **ZKPs (Zero-Knowledge Proofs):** Explore a broader range of zero-knowledge proof systems, including interactive and non-interactive variants.

- **ZK-STARKs:** Understand Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge and their role in privacy and security.

- **Homomorphic Encryption:** Dive into homomorphic encryption techniques that enable computation on encrypted data without revealing sensitive information.

- **Ring Signatures:** Explore ring signature schemes for anonymous digital signatures.
